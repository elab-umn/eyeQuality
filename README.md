# eyeQuality

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of *eyeQuality* is to provide functions for basic processing of
eye tracking data. The package is designed to support a variety of eye
tracking data sources (but was primarily tested using data exports from
Tobii Studio and Tobii Pro).

## Installation

You can install the eyeQuality from
[GitHub](https://github.com/elab-umn/eyeQuality/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("elab-umn/eyeQuality")
```

Alternatively, you can install from source by downloading the package
via github. Follow instructions outlined
[here](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/install-package-r/)

NOTE: Coming soon, we hope *eyeQuality* will be available to download
via CRAN. We will update documentation here once available!

## Package Documentation

To access package documentation and a list of all functions run

``` r
help(package = "eyeQuality")
```

## Contributing

1.  Clone github repo
2.  Open the eyeQuality.Rproj file to launch the project in RStudio
3.  Create a new branch (use the button on the “Git” pane in RStudio or
    use git commands in the Terminal)
4.  Write code
5.  Add tests using testthat package (see
    [tests/README](/tests/README.md))
6.  Add documentation using roxygen (see [R package roxygen
    instructions](https://r-pkgs.org/man.html))
7.  Once your changes are ready to be merged, submit a [pull
    request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
    on github

If you find any bugs or have feature requests, [open an issue on
github](https://github.com/elab-umn/eyetrackingELabR/issues). Please be
as detailed as possible in your issue.

## Getting started

``` r
library(eyeQuality)
```

**eyeQuality** has a number of functions, but majority of these
functions allow the pipeline to clean and categorize the data as listed.
There are two main functions that most users will use.

- `run_preprocessing()` is a function that takes a single input file and
  preprocesses it using the eyetracking pipeline
- `batch_preprocess()` takes a directory and preprocesses all of the
  files in that directory using the eyetracking pipeline. Data should be
  organized in a BIDS-like structure, such that the directory you
  provide has a list of directories for each participant, and each
  participant directory has a subdirectory for each visit or timepoint.
- `generatedEyeTrackingPlots()` will take preprocessed data from one of
  the output files and generate three different standard plots (1) a
  plot of the raw gaze data from gaze X, gaze Y, dist Z, and pupil
  diameter (2) a heatmap of gaze distribution and (3) a simplified
  output of the processed gaze data with background-filled regions for
  the IVT classification.

All of the functions are publicly available, in the case that you may
want to apply your own data pipeline.

Additionally, the function `mapData()` can be updated to handle data
from different eye tracking manufacturers software (the package
currently supports Tobii Studio and Tobii Pro). This function simply
standardized the naming of all of the

## Example Workflow

Before running the **eyeQuality** pipeline, we recommend organizing your
dataset into a BIDS like format. This means you have a top-level
directory for you dataset. Within this top level directory, there is a
directory for each participant (or subject directory), and a
subdirectory for each timepoint or visit (or session directory) for the
participant. The session directories should contain all of the raw
eyetracking data files downloaded from the collection software.

There are additional sidecar files like `dataset_description.json`,
`participants.tsv`, and `scans.tsv` that describe the data on a dataset,
participant, and session level, adding relevant metadata for the data
sets. We recommend creating these files, but they are not required to
process data via **eyeQuality**.

``` r
library(eyeQuality)

#set working directory to top-level directory for dataset
setwd("/path/to/dataset/directory")

#get the list of files in your BIDS directory
list_bids_files(".") 
#set `subject_pattern` and `session_pattern` and `modality_pattern` if different than default

#run a specific file to verify the package runs on your data------------
run_preprocess(
  "sub-10001/ses-02/sub-10001_ses-02_task-A1nameOfTask_eyetrack.tsv",
  display.dimx = 594,
  display.dimy = 344,
  savedata = TRUE,
  batchName = "test"
)

#batch process-----------------------------------
# process data in the working directory with standard defaults
batch_preprocess(".", batch_name = "run1") 
# process data in the working directory with dimensions (in mm) for a square screen
batch_preprocess(".", batch_name = "run2", display.dimx = 344, display.dimy = 344) 
batch_preprocess(".", "trial1", firstInd = 1, lastInd = 1) # process a single trial based on the eyetracking events

list_bids_derivative_files(".") # show the full list of processed data
```
